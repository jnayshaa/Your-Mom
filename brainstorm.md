## Brainstorming:
I want to create something simple but useful expecially for students, like something that helps with distarctions or something that helps with discipline or management. 

## Ideas:

1. Phone Flip Challenge - App detects when phone is placed face-down and tracks how long you keep it that way during study sessions. Gamify it with streaks and rewards.
2. App Usage Reality Check - Simple tracker that shows you exactly how many times you picked up your phone today with a gentle "Really?" notification.
3. Procrastination Timer - When you're avoiding a task, set a 2-minute timer to just START it. Often starting is the hardest part.
4. Assignment Panic Meter - Input due dates and current progress, app calculates your "panic level" and suggests next steps.
5. Quick Brain Dump - Super fast note-taking for random thoughts/ideas during lectures so they don't distract you.
6. Your Mom: A minimalist to-do & reminder app, but all reminders sound like theyâ€™re coming from your mom. Think: 
    - Not me reminding you again to drink water ðŸ™„
    - If you donâ€™t take out trash right now, I WILL LOSE MY MIND!

## Top 3 ideas
1. Your Mom 
2. App Usage Reality Check
3. Quick Brain Dump

## Thought process
I decided to build an app called 'What the Flip' which tracks your phone flip movement. However, after researching thouroughly, I found that I cannot track the flips once the app is running in the background so it isn't possible to execute this idea yet.
Thus, I am going forward with the YOUR MOM app, mainly because it should be easily executable, especially within 2-3 days.
Also because it is a fun take on the classic reminder app and this will serve as a reminder for more of the frequency related tasks that usually get pushed aside.

## Evaluation 
Mobile: Extremely mobile-specific. This app literally cannot exist as a website, it needs to exist in a place that is always accessible to you i.e. the phone. Reminders, notification timing, and habit nudges are all built around iOSâ€™s local notification system and background behavior. Task input, sorting, and UI interactions are touch-first. 

Story:  Deeply relatable and playful. Everyoneâ€™s mom texts like this. The tone of the app makes reminders feel familiar, not formal, which lowers guilt and boosts engagement. Youâ€™re not getting yelled at by your calendar, youâ€™re getting gently bullied by your mom. Adds warmth and humor to boring to-dos.

Market: Targets overwhelmed students, neurodivergent users, creatives, and honestly anyone who wants a light structure without the aesthetic pressure of apps like Notion. Very TikTok-core.

Habit: Medium engagement. Users set up recurring tasks and receive daily mom-coded nudges. Not addictive, but habit-forming in a wholesome way. 

Scope: Two view controller, basic notifications, simple data storage. MVP is achievable and still valuable. Clearly defined features.
